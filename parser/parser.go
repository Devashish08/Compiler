package parser

/*
A parser is a program that takes input data (frequently text) and builds a data structure
â€“ often some kind of parse tree, abstract syntax tree or other hierarchical structure,
giving a structural representation of the input while checking for correct syntax.

A parser is often used by the compiler to break the input into smaller elements (tokens)
and then build a parse tree. The parser is a key component in most language implementations,
which transform the source code into executable code.
